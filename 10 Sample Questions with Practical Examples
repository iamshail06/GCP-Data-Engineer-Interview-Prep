python
from google.cloud import dlp

# Initialize the DLP client
client = dlp.DlpServiceClient()

# Define the content to be inspected
content_item = {"value": "My email is john.doe@example.com and my phone number is +1234567890"}

# Define the info types to inspect for
inspect_config = {
    "info_types": [{"name": "EMAIL_ADDRESS"}, {"name": "PHONE_NUMBER"}]
}

# Run the inspection
response = client.inspect_content(parent="projects/my-project", inspect_config=inspect_config, item=content_item)

# Print the findings
for finding in response.result.findings:
    print(f"Info type: {finding.info_type.name}, Likelihood: {finding.likelihood}")
    
27. How can you optimize query performance in BigQuery?
